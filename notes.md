# Notes

Generative Art

- the artist doesnt just make the art themselves
- they work with and create a machine that creates the art

Sol LeWitt

- American artist, regarded as the founding conceptual and minimal art
- his artworks were not physically made by him in galleries
- he left a set of instructions that the builders would work from in the galleries
- the same set of instructions sometimes had different interpretations in different galleries
- created a sense of randomness and a generative aspect to his art
- [solvingsol.com](http://solvingsol.com) reimagines his instructions as JS programs
